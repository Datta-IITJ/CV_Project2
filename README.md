# Comparative Analysis of Image Segmentation
## Overview
Image segmentation is an important problem in computer vision that involves dividing an image into meaningful regions or objects. In this report, we provide an overview of the different techniques and algorithms used for image seg-mentation where we apply a comparative analysis of differ-ent deep learning methods. We modified the U-Net standard architecture and compared these architectures. We have also generated image labels for this segmentation process.

## Approach:
Using the Original U-NET Architecture: The U-NET architecture is a popular deep learning architecture for image segmentation that was introduced in 2015. It consists of a contracting path that down samples the image and a symmetric expanding path that up samples the image. The architecture uses skip connections between the contracting and expanding paths to preserve spatial information.
