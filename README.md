# Comparative Analysis of Image Segmentation
## Overview
Image segmentation is an important problem in computer vision that involves dividing an image into meaningful regions or objects. In this report, we provide an overview of the different techniques and algorithms used for image seg-mentation where we apply a comparative analysis of differ-ent deep learning methods. We modified the U-Net standard architecture and compared these architectures. We have also generated image labels for this segmentation process.
